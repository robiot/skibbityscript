# Skibidiscript
Instead of yapping in text. Yap with this language and create something.

> **friend**: Hey what are you doing tonight?

> ðŸ˜Ž **unemployed friend on a tuesday afternoon**: adding pookie classes with extreme rizz to Skibidiscript


NOTE: this language is in progress,
im currently implementing classes, and then imma make the SKUI (skibidi ui) more advanced 

## TODO:
- Implement classes in the interpreter
- Implement ForLoop in the interpreter
- Implement ObjectValue support in the interpreter
- Allow ForLoop to accept variables too after (in)

## Problems rn
- Line count is wrong

```lua
gyatt nerd

cookable mew()
    cook yap("Welcome to the ghost game. Get as many points as you can.")

    -- Define the score and default it to 0
    score is 0

    skibbity (sigma) do
        badDoor is cook nerd.randInt(1, 3)

        cook yap("Infront of you are three doors.  Which one do you choose.")
        userDoor is cook yapask("1/2/3? > ")

        sus(userDoor rizz badDoor) then 
            cook yap("BOOO! A ghost. You lost with a score of:", score)

            blud
        cap
            cook yap("Not a ghost. You survived")
            score is score + 1
